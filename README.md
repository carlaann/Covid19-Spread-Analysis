## Machine Learning of Covid19 Spread Analysis Using Polynomial 
#
1) Description
COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious disease that can cause mild to severe respiratory illness.  It appears those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and other serious illness are more at risk.  COVID-19 is an RNA virus which belongs to the family coronavirus.  It was initially emerged in China around December 2019.  The wide spread of this virus has become a pandemic. The goal of this project is to analyze the daily cases of corona virus based on confirmed cases, deaths and other parameters and predict for future days number of confirmed cases and spread factor. Spread factor is like a growth measure of this pandemic. It is calculated based on the positive increase of cases each day compared to the previous day. If the spread factor goes down, the curve of this pandemic will flatten and go down and we will witness less spread everyday of this virus. Machine learning and statistical methods like linear regression and polynomial regression were used to build our algorithms to predict for future days
